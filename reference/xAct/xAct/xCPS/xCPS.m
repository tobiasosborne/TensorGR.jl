(* :Brief Discussion:
   - xCPS extends xAct to work with vertical differentiable forms (differential forms in the space of fields).
   - Introduces the vertical exterior algebra and variational vector fields.
   - Computes the symplectic form of a field theory through variational calculus.
   - Computes the Noether currents of Noether symmetries.
